# **PROJECTS**

### **Advanced Biped Character Rigging and Animation Retargeting**  
*05/2025 – 08/2025*  
- Built biped character rigging systems in Maya with advanced limb, body, and facial setups tailored for modern game engine pipelines.  
- Used Maya Python `cmds` scripts and utility nodes to automate repetitive processes and implement custom rigging features.  
- Painted skin weights for realistic deformation based on human anatomy analysis.  
- Streamlined the workflow for transferring skeletal meshes from Maya to UE5 with clean hierarchy and naming conventions.  
- Created shaders and material instances with channel-based controls (multi-layer roughness, blended normals, tint adjustments, etc.).  
- Built IK Rig + Retargeter in UE5 to accurately retarget motion capture data across different skeletons.

### **Facial Rigging**  
*08/2025 – 10/2025*  
- Designed facial skeleton layout based on facial anatomy; built core architecture of the facial rig.  
- Created controller system including surface controllers and data-driven controllers for animation transfer.  
- Added blendshape layers and corrective shapes to enhance expressiveness and fix deformation issues.  
- Designed intuitive animator-oriented GUI connected to facial controllers.  
- Implemented automated retargeting pipeline between facial mocap data and GUI for an efficient workflow.

### **Game Design — *Beneath the Blue***  
*06/2025 – 10/2025*  
- Designed a 2D exploration-based mystery horror puzzle game in the "rule creepypasta" genre.  
- Players uncover clues, solve puzzles, identify hidden rules in the exhibition hall, and escape the aquarium.  
- Developed in Unity; art assets created in Aseprite and Procreate.

### **Greenify — Organic Agriculture Trading Platform**  
*04/2024 – 09/2024*  
- Designed a platform connecting tea producers with buyers to promote organic agriculture and reduce carbon emissions.  
- Helped consumers identify reliable sources of green products through clear evaluation standards.  
- Awards:  
  - Third Prize, Red Journey Track, China International College Students’ Innovation Competition (Beijing Division)  
  - Winner, Tsinghua University Student Innovation Competition
